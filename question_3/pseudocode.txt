Input
Hashtable of stages, performances and attendees



Process
1. Create a hashtable of all stages, their capacity, name, area in square metres, and equipment available.

2. Create a hashtable of all  performances with name, duration, equipment  needed, and  rating (priority)
 
3. Create a hashmap of attendees and their corresponding preferences.

4. Loop through the performance hashtable.
5. If the equipment needed is similar to the equipment of the stage, assign the stage to the performance; otherwise, do not assign.
6. Check the duration of the performance and assign the start time, and ensure they do not overlap.
7. Check if the capacity of the stage assigned to the performance is full.
8. If it is not full, loop through the attendees' hashmap.
9. If their preferences match the attendees, assign the performance to the attendee.
10. If it does not, do not assign any performance.
